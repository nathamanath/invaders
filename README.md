# Space invaders

I made this a while back, its hosted here: http://invaders.nathansplace.co.uk

## TODO

* audio player bugs
* proper ending
* proper start screen
* Player should not be active for a second after shot (maybe flashing)

* pass data to mixins consistently... always set instance var, then access in mixin.
* HUD is a bit shit
* Nicer speed up function as baddys are shot... end of level 2 they are much too fast.

* convert build to brunch.io
* avoid redrawing entire game each frame

## Development

### Setup

* Clone repo
* Clone submodules `git submodule init; git submodule update`
* `bundle`
* `bundle exec middleman`
